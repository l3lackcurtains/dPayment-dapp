## Introduction
Sikka is implemented on Ethereum as a Smart Contract and includes an ERC20 compatible utility token, called SIK, which is used for payments.

SIK is a general-purpose cryptocurrency that is:
- Fixed supply
- Fractionally divisible
- Non-inflationary
- Fungible and transferable

### System Architecture
<img src="res/system architecture.png" width="400"/>

#### System Components
##### User
There are two types of users: senders and receivers. The users use wallet app to perform various transactions such as sending currency.  
##### P2P nodes
P2P network is the type of network that doesn’t have any central system. Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. 
##### BlockChain
BlockChain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. It forms the heart of Sikka.
##### Mining
Mining is the process of adding transactions to the large distributed public ledger of existing transactions. The main incentive for mining is that users who choose to use a computer for mining are rewarded for doing so.

## Limitations and Further Enhancements
Limitations in our system observed so far:
- Since the value of cryptocurrency is very high, this system might not be favorable for daily micro transactions.
- Remembering of user tokens is a near tough thing to do.
- The resource demand for system running is high.
- Risk of ‘51% attack’.
- Political disagreement.

This system can be enhanced to include these following features:
- The system can be integrated to different e-commerce platforms.
- API could be provided to different trading platforms for their use.
- Different contactless technologies like MasterCard can be integrated with the system for e-shopping and contactless trading application.	
- Banks can adopt cryptocurrency to make their system more secure and reliable.
